title: "Remote Aerial Imagery using Drones (Palomar College, 2019)"
description: |
  For this project, I stitched together drone images I collected to create a photogrammetric digital surface model and orthomap of the old facilities department at Palomar College.

While at Palomar College, I took coursework in small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS). These courses taught me to become a remote pilot and how to use software (Metashape) to create orthoimage maps and aerial photogrammetry with drones.

For one project, my partner and I flew a mission over the old facilities department buildings on the Palomar College campus. I then used Metashape to create an orthoimage (Figure 1) and 3D mesh, which were then converted into a digital surface model of the buildings and surrounding area (Figure 2).
