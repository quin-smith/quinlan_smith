While at Palomar College, I completed classes in small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS). These courses taught me to become a remote pilot and how to use software like Metashape to create orthoimage maps and aerial photogrammetry with drones.

For one project, my partner and I flew a mission over the old facilities department buildings on the Palomar College campus. I used Metashape to create an orthoimage (Figure 1) and 3D mesh, which were then converted into a digital surface model of the buildings and surrounding area (Figure 2).
