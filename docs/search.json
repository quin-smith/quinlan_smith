      "contents": "\r\nQUIN SMITH, a first-year master’s student from San\r\nDiego, CA, graduated from California State University, Long Beach in\r\n2013 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Film. Before entering the\r\nenvironmental science field, Quin worked in the entertainment industry\r\nas a freelance production assistant, a courier for Warner Brothers\r\nStudios, and a production artist at a graphic design agency for movies\r\nand TV. After a career pivot in 2016, Quin returned to school to focus\r\non STEM coursework. He obtained field and research experience by\r\nvolunteering in conservation efforts including native wetland habitat\r\nrestoration with the San\r\nElijo Lagoon Conservancy, fishery health assessment with the\r\nCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife, and conservation work with\r\ncritically endangered white abalone at the NOAA\r\nSouthwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla. For two field\r\nseasons, Quin was employed by University of California\r\nstudying the attractiveness of common ornamental plants to insect\r\npollinators. In September of 2019, he began employment with UCSB’s San Onofre Nuclear\r\nGenerating Station Mitigation Monitoring Program as a wetlands field\r\nand lab assistant. This work provided foundational experience in remote\r\nsensing and image classification, experimental design, and field\r\ncollection. Quin received an Associate of Science degree in Geographic\r\nInformation Systems from Palomar College in 2020. As a Bren MESM student\r\nin the Coastal Marine Resources Management specialization, Quin is\r\ninterested in the application of GIS and remote sensing in wetlands\r\necology and is broadly interested in putting drone and LiDAR technology\r\nto the test in environmental research and analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
