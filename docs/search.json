      "contents": "\r\nQUIN SMITH hails from San Diego, CA and is a 2022\r\ngraduate of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at\r\nUC Santa Barbara. He currently holds a Master of Environmental Science\r\nand Management. In 2013, he received his Bachleor of Arts degree in Film\r\nand Electronic Arts from Cal State University, Long Beach.\r\nBefore entering the environmental science field, Quin worked in the\r\nentertainment industry as a freelance production assistant, a courier\r\nfor Warner Brothers Studios, and a production artist at a graphic design\r\nagency for movies and TV. After a career pivot in 2016, Quin returned to\r\nschool to focus on STEM coursework. He obtained field and research\r\nexperience by volunteering in conservation efforts including native\r\nwetland habitat restoration with the San Elijo Lagoon\r\nConservancy, fishery health assessment with the California\r\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife, and conservation work with critically\r\nendangered white abalone at the NOAA\r\nSouthwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla.\r\nFor two field seasons, Quin was employed by University of California\r\nstudying the attractiveness of common ornamental plants to insect\r\npollinators. In September of 2019, he began employment with UCSB’s San Onofre Nuclear\r\nGenerating Station Mitigation Monitoring Program as a wetlands field\r\nand lab assistant. This work provided foundational experience in remote\r\nsensing and image classification, experimental design, and field\r\ncollection.\r\nQuin received an Associate of Science degree in Geographic\r\nInformation Systems from Palomar College in 2020. As a Bren MESM\r\ngraduate with a Conservation Planning specialization, Quin is interested\r\nin the application of GIS and remote sensing in wetlands ecology and is\r\nbroadly interested in putting drone and LiDAR technology to the test in\r\nenvironmental research and analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
